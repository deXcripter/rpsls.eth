## Game Instructions.

#### NOTE -- Even though you can simulate both `Player1` and `Player2` from a single browser, I recommend you using two different browsers or even two different PCs to play the game.

- `Player 1` creates a game with the wallet address of player 2, `stake` some eth and make his commitment.
- `Player 2` just connects his ethereum account (it must be the same address `Player 1` used to create the game), and clicks on `Join Game`.
- After `Player 2` Joins the game, he selects his commitment and proceed. (he must have `>= stake` amount available in his wallet, else he wont be able to play the game).
- After `Player 2` plays, `Player 1` can now reveal his move, and the stake gets distributed to the winner, or splitted incase of a draw.
